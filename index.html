        <p>
            I am from Concord New Hampshire and also a graduate of the University of New Hampshire. After graduating in 2011 with a degree in Recreation Management and Business Management, I started working in the ski resort industry. Throughout my career I have worked at some great resorts in Vermont, New Hampshire and West Virginia. Most of my rolls have been in marketing and event management. This has led me to work on some really exciting events and meet really great people.
        <br>
        <br>
            recently I have been working as an event coordinator for Intown Concord, a small non-profit organization that develops and puts on events that create awareness for downtown Concord New Hampshire. 
        <br>
        <br>
            In my free time I enjoy skiing, golfing, and anything outside. I have been skiing most of my life and it has had a great impact on my career choice and lifestyle. 
        <br>
        <br> 
            I am in the process of starting a career change and I saw this program and I thought it was a great opportunity. So far it has been great and I look forward to learning more and growing my skills for the future.
